Footnotes:
1,"Postcensal estimates are based on the 2016 Census counts adjusted for census net undercoverage (CNU) (including adjustment for incompletely enumerated Indian reserves (IEIR)) and the components of demographic growth that occurred since that census. Intercensal estimates are produced using counts from two consecutive censuses adjusted for CNU (including IEIR) and postcensal estimates."
2,"Estimates are final intercensal up to 2015, final postcensal from 2016 to 2019, updated postcensal for 2020 and preliminary postcensal for 2021."
3,"Data for persons aged 90 to 100 years and over will be available from 2001."
4,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of the natural growth (Tables 17100006 and 17100016), international migration (Table 17100014) and interprovincial migration (Table 17100015)."
5,"Age at last birthday in years."
